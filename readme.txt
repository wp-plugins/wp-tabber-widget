This is a jquery based lightweight plugin to create tab in the wordpress widget. Tabs can be really useful, we can save a lot of space just by placing our block of content in tabs and displaying one block at a time in the same place. Using this plugin maximum we can display two tabs. and we can display the linkable text within the tab. in the admin we have separate page to manage the tab text.
